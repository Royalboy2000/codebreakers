# codebreakers

Welcome to Codebreakers Stager! This is a Python script that helps you create a batch file stager for downloading and executing PowerShell scripts invisibly on startup. It uses `pyfiglet` to display the "Codebreakers" ASCII art with a fancy font style and colored output for better aesthetics.
